# \<poly-graph\>

`poly-graph` is a live multi-timeseries graphing element

Key features:


* Live animated timeseries graph
* Supporting multiple 'pens' drawing lines or dots
* Pens can have custom color, line width, name (TODO: render name)
* New data points added with a timestamp or defaults to Date.now()

Wishlist (coming soon):

* It should be possible to 'lift the pen' ~ pause
* Adding limits/thresholds with labels
* Pan (mouse or finger drag) and zoom (mouse scroll or pinch) on both live and static graphs
* Pause/play timeline
* Import data for static graph (e.g. post recording)
